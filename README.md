# Alpha Zero Quoridor

An AI for quoridor based on Alpha Zero. Please check out the architecture behind the algorithm [here](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general).

A concise description of our algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/suragnair/alpha-zero-general/raw/master/pretrained_models/writeup.pdf).

### Contributing
While the current code is fairly functional, we could benefit from the following contributions:
* Asynchronous MCTS as described in the paper
* An asynchronous version of the code- parallel processes for self-play, neural net training and model comparison. 
* Game logic files for more games that follow the specifications in ```Game.py```, along with their neural networks
* Neural networks in other frameworks
* Pre-trained models for different game configurations
